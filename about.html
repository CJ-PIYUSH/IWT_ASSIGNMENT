<h3> A brief history of cloud computing </h3>

<p>
	
		Cloud computing dates back to the 1950s, and over the years, it has evolved through many phases that were first pioneered by IBM, including grid, utility and on-demand computing.
		To read a full history of cloud computing, from mainframes to how virtualization introduced the modern-day cloud, check out IBM’s history of cloud computing blog post.

<h3> Pros and cons of cloud computing. </h3>

<p>
	
					
			While the term “cloud” may seem abstract, the benefits of cloud computing to customers are very real and tangible. IBM—as well as its clients around the world—is adopting cloud computing in recognition of its potential to usher in a new era of responsiveness, effectiveness and efficiency in IT service delivery.
</p>

<p>			
			As the cloud has gained popularity and acceptance in the computing world, more and more businesses are making the switch. In fact, 75% of existing non-cloud apps will move to the cloud within the next 	 three years. Cloud computing benefits continuously evolve with the addition of new services, the conducting of uncompromising research and the creation of innovations that relentlessly push the boundaries of the underlying technology and architecture.

<h3> Seven benefits of cloud from an enterprise architecture standpoint:- </h3>

<ol> 
 
		<li>Cost efficiency</li>
 		<li> Choice</li>
 		<li>Scale: flexibility and elasticity</li>
 		<li>Speed</li>
 		<li>  Integration</li>
 		
</ol>

<h3> Types of CLoud Computing:- </h3>


<ul>

	<li><u>Platform as a service (PaaS)</u> 
		<p>
			Platform as a service provides a cloud-based environment with everything required to support the complete lifecycle of building and delivering web-based (cloud) applications — all without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware, software, provisioning and hosting.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li><u>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</u> 
		<p>
			Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) are online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li><u>Software as a service (SaaS)</u> 
		<p>
			Cloud-based applications—or software as a service—run on distant computers “in the cloud” that are owned and operated by others and that connect to users’ computers via the internet and (usually) a web browser.It is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.
